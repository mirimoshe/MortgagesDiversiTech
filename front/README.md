# Mortgages Project DiversiTech - Front

## Project Description
In this project, we used Angular to create a responsive and accessible user interface. My team and I developed Angular Material components to ensure a stable and visually consistent design, with a focus on accessibility features to enhance user experience for all audiences.

## Technologies ⚙️
**TypeScript** - I have built several projects using TypeScript in the last year  
**RxJS** - I’m familiar with RxJS for managing asynchronous data streams in Angular. Its operators and patterns have helped me handle complex data flow  
**SCSS/CSS** - I have two years of experience with CSS and SCSS. I particularly enjoy using SCSS and include it in nearly every project for its powerful features like nesting, variables, and mixins, making my styling more modular and efficient.  
**NgRx** - I've utilized NgRx for state management in Angular, enabling a more predictable and testable data flow across applications.  
**Angular CLI** - I am experienced with the Angular CLI, using it to scaffold components, generate services, and streamline development workflows.  
**HTTPClient** - I’ve worked with Angular’s HttpClient module to manage HTTP requests and handle API communication
